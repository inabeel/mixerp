Your organizational success highly depends upon employee satisfaction
and retention ratio. Once your organization has a noticeable growth, 
you may notice that human resource management quickly becomes a 
tricky and costly enterprise. Not only you have
to continuously track growth of your employees, but also you may need to 
ensure that the overall workforce stays highly motivated to achieve the 
common business goal.

As a competitive business, you need to have competitive employees. 
A competitive employee needs to have the skillset polished over time
to stay ahead in the competition.
Gone are the days when businesses assumed that they would probably get over by hiring 
new employees to be in sync the their constant growth.

As you go along, you may realize that it is a necessity to engage your existing employees 
in trainings on a timely basis to provide them periodic exposure to the best practices 
applicable to your industry.
