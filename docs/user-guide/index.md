#MixERP User Documentation

MixERP aims on being an efficient and cost-effective ERP solution. Before proceeding to the individual chapters, 
you may want to take a quick note on the following topics:

##MixERP Is Desiged for Multi-Establishment

MixERP is a multi-establishment ERP software solution which facilitates you to run **any number of branch offices** 
in a **centralized environment**. This means, if you have multiple branch offices of the same establishment, 
you **should not create** multiple companies (and databases) or host separate application for each branch. 
You **should, instead,** create a single office with branch offices as children as shown in the image.

##Establishment Types

An office can contain sub-offices, thence making the office **a branch group**. Likewise, an office which does not
have any child office makes it **a transaction unit**.

You can only perform transaction posting to the transaction units, whereas a branch group allows you to consolidate
and produce reports of all child offices it contains.

###Remember
* Chart of Accounts is establishment-neutral. The Accounts (GL Heads) are common to all offices.
* Parties (Customers or Suppliers) are also establishment-neutral and common to all offices.
* A GL Head can have different closing balance on different offices.
* A GL Head balance when viewed on a parent office means the sum of all child offices.
* A party has a payable or receivable balance according to office.
  A party balance when viewed on a parent office means the sum of all child offices.
* A stock item has an inventory balance according to office.
  A stock item balance when viewed on parent office means the sum of all child offices.
* You cannot post transactions to an office group (an office which has child offices).
* You can create General Ledgers (Accounts), Stock Items, Parties when logged in to any office. 
  Remember these entities are global--shared by all offices.
