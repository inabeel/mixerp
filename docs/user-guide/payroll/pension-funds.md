            State whether or not the deductions related to this pension fund
            are taxable. If you specify this pension fund as
            taxable, the <strong>deductions will appear after</strong> taxable
            salary items. Whereas nontaxable <strong>deductions will appear
            along with</strong> the taxable salary item, thus reducing the total
            taxable earnings.
